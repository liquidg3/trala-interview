# Phone Book App

## Challenge 
Build a simple phone book app. Build it as a single user web app: no need to build authorization or accounts. We provide a simple “CRU” REST API to use for your development. 

## Requirements

● The home page displays all of your contact names.
● Clicking on a person’s name brings up a way to edit that contact’s details.
● There is an "add" button to add a new contact.
● Validations should be consistent with the API definition
● Visuals should be simple. Functional is better than perfect. There are no extra points for
making it “pretty.”
